# NeuralNetwork_From_Scratch
Creating the building blocks of a deep neural network from scratch in Python.

Here, I have coded the building blocks of a basic Deep Neural Network Architecture from scratch in Python. This is to exemplify the concepts and re-iterate 
the understanding of a DNN. All functions here are written from the start without re-using DNN libraries, including, forward/back propogation, gradients, 
weights update, loss calculation, etc.

**Rough topics exemplified:**

* Expression tree of weights and biases

* Derivatives

* Chain rule

* Manual forward propagation

* Manual back propagation

* Neuron

* MLP

* Matrix representation

* Activation Function

* Gradient descent

* Loss function

* Deep Neural Network Architecture with a Binary classifier
